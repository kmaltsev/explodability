# explodability

This repository contains two user-friendly and accessible Jupyter Notebooks (written in Python) that contain the source code related to the paper [Maltsev et al. (submitted)](https://arxiv.org/).

The first notebook "Explodability_and_Fallback_criteria.ipynb" entails the explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova (SN) mechanism. These address the progenitor problem: which stars will succeed and which will fail to explode when their iron core collapses? The criteria predict the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and constrain the remnant type (*neutron star* or *fallback black hole*) left behind a successful SN explosion based on pre-SN structure variables at the onset of iron-core infall.

The second notebook "CCSN_recipe_for_BPS.ipynb" presents the core collapse supernova (CCSN) recipe for binapy population synthesis that is based on the carbon-oxygen core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, metallicity $Z$ and mass transfer history of stars. The recipe predicts the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and remnant type (neutron star or black hole) of massive single and binary-stripped stars that undergo iron-core collapse at the end of their evolution. Since these predictions can be made already at the end of core helium burning and the recipe is fast-to-evaluate, it is applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies at scale.

The Jupyter Notebooks contain in-line comments that document the essential steps and visualizations.
