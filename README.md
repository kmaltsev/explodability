# explodability

This repository contains two user-friendly and accessible Jupyter Notebooks (written in Python) that contain the source code related to the paper [Maltsev et al. (submitted)](https://arxiv.org/).

The first notebook entails the explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova (SN) mechanism. These address the progenitor problem: which SN progenitors will succeed and which will fail to explode? The criteria predict the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and constrain the remnant type (*neutron star* or *fallback black hole*) left behind a successful SN explosion based on pre-SN structure of the SN progenitor.

The second notebook presents the core collapse supernova (CCSN) recipe for binapy population synthesis that is based on the carbon-oxygen core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$. The recipe predicts the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and remnant type (neutron star or black hole) of massive single and binary-stripped stars that undergo iron-core collapse at the end of their evolution. Since these predictions can be made already at the end of core helium burning and the recipe is fast-to-evaluate, it is applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies at scale.
