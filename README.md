Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism

This repository contains two very accessible Jupyter Notebooks (written in Python) that contain the source code related to the paper [Maltsev et al. (submitted)](https://arxiv.org/).

The first notebook entails the explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova (SN) mechanism. These address the progenitor problem: which SN progenitors will succeed and which will fail to explode? The criteria predict the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and constrain the remnant type (*neutron star* or *fallback black hole*) left behind a successful SN explosion.

The second notebook presents the core collapse supernova (CCSN) recipe for binapy population synthesis. It predicts the final fate (*failed* or *successful SN*) and remnant type (neutron star or black hole) of massive single and binary-stripped stars that undergo iron-core collapse at the end of their evolution. Using the recipe, these predictions can be made already at the end of core helium burning. Since the recipe is analytical and therefore fast-to-evaluate, it is applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies at scale.
